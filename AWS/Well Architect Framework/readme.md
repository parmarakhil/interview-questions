# Well Architect framework

1. Reliability
    1. The ability of a system to recover from infra or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
    2. Test recovery procedures (disaster recovery)
    3. Auto recover from failure
    4. Scale horizontally
    5. Stop guessing capacity
    6. Manage change in automation
2. Performance efficiency
    1. The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
    2. Democratise advanced technologies
    3. Go global in minutes
    4. Use serverless architectures 
    5. Experiment more often
    6. Mechanical sympathy (requirement determine tech to use)
3. Security
    1. Ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value
    2. Implement a strong identity foundation
    3. Enable traceability
    4. Apply security at all levels
    5. Automate security best practice
    6. Protect data in transit and rest
    7. Keep people away from data
    8. Prepare for security events
4. Cost optimisation
    1. Ability to run systems to deliver business value at lowest cost
    2. Adopt a consumption model
    3. Measure overall efficiency
    4. Stop spending money on data centre operations
    5. Analyze and attribute expenditure
    6. Use managed service to reduce total cost of ownership
5. Operational excellence
    1. Ability to run and monitor business process
    2. Perform operations as code
    3. Annotated documentation
    4. Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    5. Refine operations procedures frequently
    6. Anticipate failure
    7. Learn from all operation failures
