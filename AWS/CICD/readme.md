# CICD

1. Code Commit
    1. A fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories, similar to Github.
    2. You can create your own code repository and use Git commands to interact with your own repository and other repositories.
    3. You can store and version any kind of file, including application assets such as images and libraries alongside your code.
    4. The AWS CodeCommit Console lets you visualize your code, pull requests, commits, branches, tags and other settings.
    5. You can migrate a Git repository to a CodeCommit repository in a number of ways: by cloning it, mirroring it, or migrating all or just some of the branches.
    6. You can also migrate your local repository in your machine to CodeCommit.
    7. You can transfer your files to and from AWS CodeCommit using HTTPS or SSH. For HTTPS authentication, you use a static username and password. For SSH authentication, you use public keys and private keys.
    8. Your repositories are also automatically encrypted at rest through AWS KMS using customer-specific keys.
    9. You can give users temporary access to your AWS CodeCommit repositories through a number of methods: SAML, Federation, Cross-Account Access, or through third party authorizes with Amazon Cognito.
